# react-storybook-rollup
**Maintain your UI library as a separate project!**

This project contains a combination of:
* [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) - the UI environment for developing React components
* [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) - module bundler that bundles all your components

### What does it do?
* It lets you develop your React components in isolation
* It serves as documentation of your components for designers and other developers
* It bundles all your components developed with Storybook into one single portable dependency that you can inject into your app.

Storybook is awesome tool. And Rollup is an awesome bundler. But combined together they are twice as awesome!

### Usage
1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run storybook` in order to run Storybook, visit localhost:6006
